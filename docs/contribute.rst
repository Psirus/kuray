Contribute
==========

*Kuray* is still in a very early phase of development, and could always use
a bit of help. Here are a couple of things you could do to help out:

File Bug Reports
----------------

As with most open source projects, *Kuray* does not have a dedicated team
of testers, so it depends on the community to report back any bugs, problems
or issues it has. Feature requests are also openly encouraged. So please
feel free to report any of these at our `Github Issue tracker`_.

.. _Github Issue tracker: https://github.com/Psirus/kuray/issues

Artwork and Interface Design
----------------------------

*Kuray* still needs a logo, and if you're interested in web design, you could
provide a unique look to these pages. At the moment, *Kurays* user interface is
relatively straight forward, but as the number of options rise, clutter will
increase. If you have a vision for going forward in this area, please do get
in touch via the `Mailing List`_.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation always needs to be expanded or improved. Fix typos, make
difficult sections clearer and contribute in this important area of the
project. Send a pull request at `Github`_ or post on the `Mailing List`_.

Windows and MacOSX ports
------------------------

*Kuray* is written completely in Python, and uses only cross-platform
libraries. I'm using and developing it on Linux, but it would be nice to offer
Windows and Mac binaries. I've successfully built a Windows binary using
pyinstaller_, but don't have enough Windows experience to feel comfortable
making quality releases. No experiences with *Kuray* on Mac so far, but I'd
really like to see this change. So if you're interested in seeing *Kuray* on
your favourite platform drop us a line at the `Mailing List`_.

Coding
------

Naturally, we would love to see coding contributions. If you have fixed a bug
or implementated a new feature, share it with the rest of us. We'd love to
merge your pull request via `Github`_.
